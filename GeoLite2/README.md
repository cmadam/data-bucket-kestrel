# GeoLite2 Database

This directory hosts GeoLite2 databases intended for use in Kestrel cloud
sandbox services only. Please visit [kestrel-huntbook](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-huntbook) repo to understand Kestrel cloud sandboxes, use considerations and terms.

If you would like to deploy your own Kestrel analytics with the GeoLite2
database, you need to register and download the database from
[MAXMIND](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), as described in the
[piniponmap analytics](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/analytics/piniponmap) in the [kestrel-analytics](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/) repo.

If you would like to use GeoLite2 outside Kestrel, you need to register and
download the database from
[MAXMIND](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/).
